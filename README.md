# ML Pipeline Template (Sklearn)

A clean starter structure for training + evaluating a machine learning model.

## What it does
- Loads a dataset (sklearn built-in for now)
- Splits train/test
- Trains a baseline model
- Evaluates with accuracy + confusion matrix
- Saves outputs

## How to run (later today)
1. Install requirements
2. Run `python src/train.py`
3. Run `python src/evaluate.py`

## Next week improvements
- Add validation split + cross-validation
- Add better metrics (F1, ROC-AUC)
- Add real dataset + feature engineering
